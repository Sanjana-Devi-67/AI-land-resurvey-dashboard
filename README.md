# 🗺️ AI-Assisted Land Resurvey Intelligence Dashboard

## 📌 Problem Statement
The Government of Andhra Pradesh is conducting a large-scale land resurvey initiative using modern geospatial technologies such as drones, GNSS, and CORS networks.  
Manual parcel verification and conflict resolution lead to delays, inconsistencies, and disputes.

This project demonstrates an **AI-assisted decision support system** that automatically identifies land parcel discrepancies, prioritizes high-risk cases, and supports faster, transparent resurvey operations.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect discrepancies between textual land records (ROR) and resurvey measurements
- Identify boundary conflicts and high-risk parcels
- Assist survey officers with inspection prioritization
- Provide a clean, interactive visualization dashboard
- Support inspection validation and reporting

---

## 🤖 Where AI Is Used
This system uses **Explainable AI and Decision Intelligence**, not black-box models.

- Automated anomaly detection between ROR and resurvey data
- Rule-based risk scoring (Low / Medium / High)
- Intelligent prioritization of parcels for inspection
- Policy-sensitive threshold simulation
- Human-in-the-loop validation workflow

> AI here focuses on **decision acceleration and transparency**, which is critical for governance systems.

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard Modules
- **Overview**: KPIs, maps, analytics, and inspection workflow
- **Export Reports**: Download updated inspection data
- **Policy Thresholds**: Simulate regulatory sensitivity
- **Zone Aggregation**: Identify dispute-prone zones
- **Inspection SLA**: Monitor inspection timelines and delays

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Folium (Geospatial Visualization)**

---

## 🚀 Deployment
The application is deployed using **Streamlit Community Cloud**, which supports Python-based interactive dashboards.

> Netlify is not used, as it supports only static front-end applications.

---

## 📈 Expected Impact
- Reduced manual effort for survey teams
- Faster identification of dispute-prone parcels
- Improved transparency and auditability
- Accelerated land resurvey workflows
- Better decision support for land governance

---

## 🧪 Proof of Concept Scope
- Implemented for a single mandal
- Covers 100+ simulated land parcels
- Demonstrates scalable architecture for statewide rollout

---

## 📜 Disclaimer
This project is a **proof-of-concept** developed for internship and hackathon purposes using synthetic data.  
It does not use real citizen or cadastral records.
